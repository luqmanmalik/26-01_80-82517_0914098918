## Calculus
### 4E Problem Sets &#9634; Michael Spivak
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

[Calculus](https://archive.org/details/Calculus_643) is the first volume in the eight–part analysis sequence by mathematician and author Michael Spivak. To anyone with a keen palate for the rigor of the subject, and equal regard for its utility, I recommend _The Hitchhiker's Guide to Calculus_ (Spivak), and _What is Calculus about_ (W.W. Sawyer)[<sup>+</sup>](https://archive.org/details/W.W.SawyerWhatIsCalculusAbout) as companions to enjoy alongside this volume.

__Part V (Epilogue)__ of the book concludes with chapters on the construction of the real numbers and a demonstration of the uniqueness of the real numbers. I use this model to explore a forking  **F : (N** &rarr; **&real;)** that revisits some fundamental assumptions about (0, &#x221e;). In doing so, I am considering the arguments of Dedekind–Peano, Weierstrass–Cauchy–Spivak, and A. Robinson.

__Required tech()__ This repository is Safari–centric and designed on a 13" MacBook running OS X El Capitan. Given the simplex design of the page–frame (HTML_CSS, MathJax) versus the complex embedding of the carousel<sup>4</sup> main–frame (JS, PHP, c++), a browser–universal repository seems exessive and idyllic at this stage.
