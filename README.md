## Calculus
### 4E Problem Sets &#9634; Michael Spivak
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

__Calculus__ is the first volume in the eight–part analysis sequence by mathematician and author Michael Spivak. To anyone with a keen palate for the rigor of the subject, and equal regard for its utility, I recommend _The Hitchhiker's Guide to Calculus_ (Spivak), and _What is Calculus about_ (W.W. Sawyer) as companions to enjoy alongside this volume. Digital copies of the third edition have been made available at the Internet Archive.[<sup>+</sup>](https://archive.org/details/Calculus_643) I will have the page–frame available as a Safari application pretty soon. It will be released as an open Hilix product under MITL.

__Part V (Epilogue)__ of the book concludes with chapters on the construction of the real numbers and a demonstration of the uniqueness of the real numbers. I use this model to explore a forking  **F : (N** &rarr; **&real;)** that revisits some fundamental assumptions about (0, &#x221e;). In doing so, I am considering the arguments of Dedekind–Peano, Weierstrass–Cauchy–Spivak, and A. Robinson.

__Specifications()__ This repository is Safari–centric and designed on a 13" MacBook running OS X El Capitan. The page frame is an eleventh–order quaternion prismplex, with eight closed (dynamic) fields. It may also be described as a partial frame, meaning that ¬(every closed field has slide and scroll fucntionality) in contrast to a complete frame, where every closed field has slide and scroll functionality. The frame's memory is accesible through conventional menus and search. Far less conventionally, each slide has an autonomous search engine, whose query returns remain loaded in the RAM while sliding through pages. The library is licensed for use under the terms in the file <code>MIT_License</code>.
