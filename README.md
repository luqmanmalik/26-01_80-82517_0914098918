## Calculus
### 4E Problem Sets &#9634; Michael Spivak
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

__Calculus__ is the first volume in the eight–part analysis sequence by mathematician and author Michael Spivak. To anyone with a keen palate for the rigor of the subject, and equal regard for its utility, I recommend _The Hitchhiker's Guide to Calculus_ (Spivak), and _What is Calculus about_ (W.W. Sawyer) as companions to enjoy alongside this volume. Digital copies of the third edition are available at the Internet Archive.[<sup>+</sup>](https://archive.org/details/Calculus_643)

__Part V (Epilogue)__ of the book concludes with chapters on the construction of the real numbers and a demonstration of the uniqueness of the real numbers. I use this model to explore a forking  **F : (N** &rarr; **&real;)** that revisits some fundamental assumptions about (0, &#x221e;). In doing so, I am considering the arguments of Dedekind–Peano, Weierstrass–Cauchy–Spivak, and A. Robinson.

__Required tech()__ This repository is Safari–centric and designed on a 13" MacBook running OS X El Capitan. The page–frame is a four–dimensional, infinite–scroll slider written in JavaScript. It may also be described as a partial frame — meaning that ¬(every closed field is a slider) in contrast to a complete fraim, where every closed field has slide and scroll functionality. The search bars use standard Big O search algorithms also written in JS. The library is licensed for use under the terms in the file <code>MIT_License</code>.
