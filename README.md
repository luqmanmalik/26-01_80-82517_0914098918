## Calculus
### 4E Problem Sets &#9634; Michael Spivak
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

__Calculus__ is the first element in the eight–part Spivak analysis sequence. **CLC_FE**, therefore, is the first installment in my corresponding solution sequence.

**Part V (Epilogue)** of the book concludes with chapters on the construction of the real numbers, and a demonstration of the uniqueness of the real numbers. In response, I offer some remarks on the Peano–Dedekind construction of **N** with the aim of expanding that set of arguments to **&real;** via Part V of the present text and also with a look ahead to Abrahm Robinson's work on non–standard analysis.

Copyrighting dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone a/o fork of each version of the source, a well–defined copyright ecology is formed within the repository's historical record. Furthermore, by compiling the unique metadata of each version>clone>fork its structural distance from the source can be measured and evaluated. Therefore, [local_contribut_data + metadata(repo) + License]::**authenticate**::S_code(author).
