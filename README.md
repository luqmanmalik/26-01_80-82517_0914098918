## Calculus
### 4E Problem Sets &#9634; Michael Spivak
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

__Calculus__ is the first element in the eight–part Spivak analysis sequence. **CLC_FE**, therefore, is the first installment in my corresponding solution sequence.

**Part V (Epilogue)** of the book concludes with chapters on the construction of the real numbers, and a demonstration of the uniqueness of the real numbers. In response, I offer some remarks on the Peano–Dedekind construction of **N** with the aim of expanding that set of arguments to **&real;** via Part V of the present text and also with a look ahead to Abrahm Robinson's work on non–standard analysis.

**Required tech:** All of my rpositories are Safari–centric. Given the simplex design of the page–frame (HTML_CSS, MathJax) versus the complex embedding of the carousel<sup>4</sup> main–frame (JS, PHP, c++), a browser–universal repository seems exessive and idyllic at this stage.

**Copyrighting** dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone a/o fork of each version of the source, a well–defined attribution ecology is formed within the repository's historical record. Furthermore, by compiling the metadata of each version>clone>fork, one can analize the structural distance of that copy from the source. Therefore, [repo + metadata(repo) + License]::**authenticate**::autr(s_code).
